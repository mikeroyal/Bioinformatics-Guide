[Bioinformatics](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Bioinformatics) is a field of computational science that has to do with the analysis of sequences of biological molecules. This usually refers to genes, DNA, RNA, or protein, and is particularly useful in comparing genes and other sequences in proteins and other sequences within an organism or between organisms, looking at evolutionary relationships between organisms, and using the patterns that exist across DNA and protein sequences to figure out what their function is.
